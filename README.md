# Signature-Verification

## Overview 
Handwritten signatures serve as a crucial means of authentication. However, forged signatures pose a significant threat, leading to various fraudulent activities. This project focuses on identifying forged signatures using Siamese Neural Networks, aiming to mitigate the risks associated with fraudulent activities, such as random forgery, unskilled forgery, and skilled forgery.
